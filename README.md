# SA_Lottery_System

I have decided to design a South African lotto system using the following:

•	My solution is model driven; this makes it easy to identify business models in my solution. 
•	I used Abstract method to implement polymorphism 
•	Large portions of code have been decomposed into small chunks to enforce Single Responsibility Principle and avoid repetition of code.
•	I used Inheritance to reuse code that is common or that might be potentially common in future implementation. This approach also makes it easy 
  to make changes without affecting other classes.
